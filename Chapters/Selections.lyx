 These selections are the continuation of previous works that developed

 and the TPC.

 The Production 5 software was actively used between 2012 and early 2014
 until it was replaced by Production 6.
 However, physics analyzers are not as rapid to adopt the software updates.

 A

 desired properties.
 The pre-selection cuts are designed in particular to filter out poor data

\begin_layout Section
Global Reconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The task of the Global reconstruction is to combine all of the ND280 information
 into a combined reconstructed object.
 It was originally designed to identify CC-
\begin_inset Formula $0\pi$
\end_inset

 events in the Tracker, FGD+TPC, region and has been extended to operate
 with all of ND280.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Global reconstruction is a software package that attempts to recognize
 patterns of deposited energy in ND280 and categorize it accordingly.
 Particles that deposit energy in long, linear segments are categorized
 as tracks.
 If multiple tracks originate from a common origin (vertex), it is likely
 a true neutrino interaction event occurred nearby.
 Particle cascade (shower) reconstruction in Global will not be discussed
 since they are not selected in this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each subdetector reconstruction algorithm is run separately as the seed
 to Global's track matching algorithms.
 This includes the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

's track-finding algorithm, which define a 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 track as a linear sequence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nodes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with one at each bar layer.
 Each node represents the approximate position where the particle intersected
 the scintillating layer.
 To facilitate inter-detector matching, Global attempts to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

re-fit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 track using a Kalman filter
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kalmanFilter"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The re-fit procedure also corrects for particle energy loss as a function
 of length and multiple scattering processes.
 A 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 vertex, which is the assumed location of the neutrino interaction, is then
 associated with the re-fit track using another Kalman filter algorithm.
 Matching tracks between the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 and the TPC is done automatically in the ND280 Global fit.

 Selection Cuts
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:The-P0D-Selection-Cuts"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of CC-inclusive events uses a series of cuts to select the
 muon track.
 Prior to any cuts and after the reconstruction, corrections are applied
 first to both data and MC events to correct for well known residual differences
 between them.
 This includes correcting the MC flux prediction using the secondary beamline
 and INGRID data and reconstruction efficiency corrections.
 A complete list of the corrections applied are given in the following reference
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Abe2015c"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The pre-selection cuts (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

precuts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) are then applied to extract events that start in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 fiducial volume (FV).
 The last set of cuts are designed to select the muon that enters the TPC.
 The following sections will describe the precuts common to all CC-inclusive
 selections and the branching of different cuts, after the precuts, to select
 a muon track.

 They were then used with the Global reconstruction software for the

\end_inset

 which is the software interface that BANFF uses to select events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to the precuts, neutrino interaction data event must be collected
 and reconstructed for each T2K beam spill.
 Each T2K beam spill has eight bunches that are 58 ns long and temporally
 separated by 581 ns.
 When the beam spill occurs, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

's Trip-T electronics are triggered to collect data in preset integration
 cycles aligned with the bunches.
 Each integration cycle is 480 ns long and is followed by a 100 ns dead-time
 to prepare for the next cycle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Das2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The data collected in each cycle is used to reconstruct neutrino interaction
 events using the ND280 subdetector and Global software packages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each reconstructed event must pass the following cuts before being assigned
 to a selection:

 position that is more accurate than the individual readout micromegas.

on.
 The set of nodes are used to fit a helix shaped track.
\end_layout

After passing of all the precuts, a single, global track, which is observed
 in TPC1, is assigned as the lepton candidate or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main track
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a selected event.
 While the main track is different for each selected event, but the momentum
 reconstruction is the same.
 The momentum of the main track, 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, is sum of its momentum in the TPC, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\text{TPC}}$
\end_inset

, with the estimate momentum lost in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta P_{\pod}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P=P_{\text{TPC}}+\Delta P_{\pod}.\label{eq:momentumP0D}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The momentum lost in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 is estimated by summing the total momentum loss along the track path 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta P=\int_{\mathcal{C}}\left(\frac{dP}{dx}\right)dx,\label{eq:energyloss}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $dP/dx$
\end_inset

 is the momentum loss function.
 The momentum loss function is related to the energy loss function, 
\begin_inset Formula $dE/dx$
\end_inset

 via the chain rule
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\frac{dE}{dx} & =\left(\frac{dE}{dP}\right)\left(\frac{dP}{dx}\right)\\
 & =\frac{d}{dP}\left(\sqrt{P^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}}\right)\left(\frac{dP}{dx}\right)\\
 & =\left(\frac{Pc^{2}}{E}\right)\left(\frac{dP}{dx}\right)\\
 & =\beta c\left(\frac{dP}{dx}\right),
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:chainrule}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the particle velocity as a ratio of the speed of light 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Since the reconstructed track's path 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 is not infinitesimally precise due to inherent detector resolution, we
 must replace the integral with a sum and differential 
\begin_inset Formula $dx\rightarrow\Delta x$
\end_inset

.
 We then arrive at the expression of the momentum loss estimate in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 as

.
 In FHC mode, the vast majority of neutrino interactions are 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 CC events that produce an outgoing, negatively charged muon.
 If there is no negatively charged track in the TPC, the event is likely
 not a 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

-induced interaction.
 Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 CC-inclusive selection in FHC mode has one cut:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At least one negatively charged track is reconstructed in the TPC.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
An event is rejected if none of the TPC tracks have a reported negative
 curvature.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If the event passes this cut, the highest momentum negative (curvature)
 track, or HMNT, is selected as the lepton candidate.
 This selection and all subsequent selections are branched into two categories
 based on the number of tracks counted in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

.
 If there is only one 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 track, and hence only one track in the TPC as required by the precuts,
 the event is categorized as a

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In RHC mode, the majority of the beam neutrinos are 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 since the horn focuses negatively charged pions.
 However, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 background interaction rate in RHC mode is larger than the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 background in FHC mode.
 The reason for this is two fold.
 Firstly, the antineutrino-nuclear scattering cross section is suppressed
 by ~1/3 compared to the neutrino-nuclear scattering cross section as explained
 in 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
mbox{Section~
\backslash
ref{subsec:Neutrino-Scattering-with-Matter}}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Secondly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 flux in RHC is relatively large near the energy peak mode due to the excess
 of positively charged pions generated at the target.
 Therefore there is a non-negligible 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong-sign
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 background in RHC mode that we need to reject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to this analysis, a 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 CC-
\begin_inset Formula $0\pi$
\end_inset

 selection was developed for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 CC-
\begin_inset Formula $0\pi$
\end_inset

 selection is quite similar to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 CC-inclusive selection in FHC mode described above, but relied on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 local reconstruction for a particle identification cut.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 local reconstruction is, however, unavailable in the event selection software
 used in the BANFF fit called psyche.
 So a new selection was developed specifically for this analysis to select
 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 interactions in RHC mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 CC-inclusive selection in RHC mode uses the precuts described in Subsection
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the has two cuts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At least one positively charged track is reconstructed in the TPC.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
An event is rejected if none of the TPC tracks have a reported positive
 curvature.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The highest momentum positive (curvature) track, or HMPT, must be the highest
 momentum track.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If the highest momentum track has negative curvature, then the event is
 rejected.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If the event passes these two cuts, the HMPT is the lepton candidate.
 If there is only one 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in the previous subsection, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 background interaction rate in RHC mode is relatively large compared to
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 interaction rate.
 Having a measurement of this background is critical for the oscillation
 analysis due to the small number of expected 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar\rightarrow\nuebar$
\end_inset

 counts.
 To date, there is no 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 background in RHC mode, nor any 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 selection to do so.
 So like the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 CC-inclusive selection, a new 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 selection was developed exclusively for this analysis to select 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 background events in RHC mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

These signal classes also must occur in the

 The non-CCQE category can be further divided among the dominant T2K CC
 and all NC interactions modes as enumerated in

 An out of FV (OOFV) event is any true event that occurs in ND280, but is
 falsely reconstructed in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 FV.
 Another important ND280 background are true neutrino and antineutrino CC
 interactions occurring in the sand surrounding the ND280 pit with the muon
 track falsely reconstructed in the FV.
 These events are referred to as

The name 2p2h originates from Condensed Matter Physics which motivated the
 model.
 In solid state matter, a

 refers to the absence of an electron in a valence band.
 In the High Energy Physics context, 2p2h considers neighboring and interacting
 nucleon pairs (2p) scattering from an incoming

This selection contains a modest fraction of non-CCQE interactions.
 The largest contamination is 
\begin_inset Formula $1\pion$

 interactions, which can happen primarily for a couple of reasons.
 Firstly, when the final state pion is produced, it is subject to final
 state interactions (FSI) where a pion can be absorbed or scattered in the
 nucleus.
 Secondly, and more importantly, a pion might not be reconstructed as a
 track in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 if its energy is below reconstruction threshold.
 Together, the large 
\begin_inset Formula $1\pion$

 background affects the CC-

\end_inset

 and CC-
\begin_inset Formula $1\pi$

 Here we see in better detail the origin of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 contamination.
 As a function of increasing energy, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

 content is decreasing while the relative 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 contribution is increasing.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 events also have high 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{2}$
\end_inset

 which explains the significant number of misidentified proton main track
 events.
 For the hadronic final states, the shape of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numubar$
\end_inset

-induced resonances is similar to what we saw in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

\end_inset

 Interestingly, the

 background hadronic mass distribution does not peak in any one region.

 We can see this is a relatively low-angle selection compared to previous
 selections.
 Importantly the selection is relatively

 However, the CCQE purity is modest given number of correctly identified
 lepton candidates.
 This feature will have to be analyzed in the next iteration of the analysis.

 The flux of the wrong-sign background is not sharply peaked nor is the
 peak at 0.6 GeV but at 1 GeV.
 Since these are higher energy events, there is more available energy to
 produce resonance states that produce

 topologies.
 This explains the significant non-CCQE event contamination.

Summary of Selections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we have examined the selection true and reconstruction kinematic
s that will used in the BANFF fit.
 We see the 1-Track selections yield some reasonably pure CCQE samples.
 By inverting that cut, we obtain some information on the rate of other
 topologies like CC-
\begin_inset Formula $1\pi$
\end_inset

 and high 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{2}$
\end_inset

 CCDIS events.
 Importantly is the ability to constrain the correct sign 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 and wrong sign backgrounds in RHC mode, which are very important in the
 oscillation analysis.
 We can now move forward to the next chapter to examine the systematic uncertain
ties present in the analysis.
