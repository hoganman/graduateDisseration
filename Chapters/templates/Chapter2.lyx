It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the
 personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were
 too much for our belief.
 This system--which has often comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted
 the consolations of Strauss for those of the New Testament--has been of
 incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present
 centuries.
 To question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable
 act, than to believe in that of Romulus.
 To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a
 theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read
 in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured
 old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized

Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and
 the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission
 to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition,
 concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey.
 What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although
 the arguments appear to run in a circle.
 "This cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because
 it cannot be true." Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon
 testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and oblivion

It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are
 partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which
 truth is the requisite most wanting.
 Before taking a brief review of the Homeric theory in its present conditions,
 some notice must be taken of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has
 been attributed to Herodotus.

According to this document, the city of Cumae in Ã†olia, was, at an early
 period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece.
 Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.
 Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named
 Critheis.
 The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of
 Cleanax, of Argos.
 It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we "are indebted for so much
 happiness." Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received
 the name of Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in
 Boeotia, whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"At this time," continues our narrative, "there lived at Smyrna a man named
 Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married, engaged
 Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as the
 price of his scholastic labours.
 So satisfactory was her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct,
 that he made proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,
 willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,
 if he were carefully brought up."

They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature
 had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every
 attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom.
 Phemius died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon
 followed.
 Melesigenes carried on his adopted father's school with great success,
 exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also
 of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the exportation
 of corn, attracted to that city.
 Among these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura,
 who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded
 Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his travels.

 discourses." Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron, "examining
 all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and informing himself
 of everything by interrogating those whom he met." We may also suppose,
 that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation.

Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse,
 and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical
 superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.
 Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became acquainte
d with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed the subject
 of the Odyssey.

"Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the beginning,
 rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the existing habits
 of society with regard to poetry--for they admit generally that the Iliad
 and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,--but upon the supposed
 necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation
 of the poems--the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient
 nor trustworthy.

Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard
 was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript;
 for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification
 for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the example
 of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of Chios,
 in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as the general
 tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself.
 The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a
 blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been
 conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference
 to the manuscript in his chest."

The loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon which
 even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt,
 that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable
 change.
 Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems could have
 suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved.
 If Chaucer's poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only
 have come down to us in a softened form, more like the effeminate version
 of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble original.

The count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna, the countess followed on
 the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because Nicholas
 was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikhaylovna with Shinshin.
 Berg gave his arm to Vera.
 The smiling Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas.
 After them other couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last
 of all the children, tutors, and governesses followed singly.
 The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the
 gallery, and the guests settled down in their places.
 Then the strains of the count's household band were replaced by the clatter
 of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the
 footmen.

From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing
 at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled
 his neighbors' glasses, not neglecting his own.
 The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant
 glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head
 seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair.
 At the ladies' end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at
 the men's end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of
 the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank
 so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests.

Berg with tender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but
 a heavenly feeling.
 Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging
 glances with Natasha, who was sitting opposite.
 Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal.
 Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the
 game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.
 These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin,
 from behind the next man's shoulders and whispered: "Dry Madeira"...
 "Hungarian"...
 or "Rhine wine" as the case might be.
 Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count's monogram that stood
 before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment,
 gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests.
 Natasha, who sat opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen look
 at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time.
 Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl's
 look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why.

Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Julie Karagina, to whom
 he was again talking with the same involuntary smile.
 Sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now
 she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what
 Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another.
 The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any
 slight that might be put upon the children.
 The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds
 of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people
 in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle
 wrapped in a napkin passed him by.
 He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but
 was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench
 his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientiou
s desire for knowledge.
