The history of the neutrino can be traced back to the electron energy spectrum
 observed in neutron 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay.
 While measurements of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

-decay of atomic nuclei showed discrete spectral lines, the electron (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 particle) exhibited a continuous energy spectrum.
 Experimentally, there were two observed particles in each decay process
 and classical physics dictated that the outgoing daughter particles should
 have discrete energies.
 The fact that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay spectrum was very different posed a fundamental problem for physicists
 in the mid-1910s, which was that energy was not conserved.
 Two solutions were postulated: either the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

energy conservation law is only valid statistically in such a process [...]
 or an additional undetectable new particle [...] carrying away the additional
 energy and spin [...] is emitted
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 The latter solution was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in a letter dated 4
 December 1930 to a group of physicists meeting in Tübingen, modern Germany,
 where he first proposed the neutrino

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In W Pauli's December 1930 letter, he referred to his proposed particle
 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutron
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is not the same neutron that we know of today.
 At that point in time, the neutral particles inside the atomic nucleus,
 also called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutrons
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, had not been discovered, let alone understood.
 The neutron, which was discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick, has been formally
 associated as the neutral, cousin particle to the proton.
 It would be Enrico Fermi who would coin the particle in W Pauli's letter
 and solution to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay spectrum as a

 Pauli's solution also predicted that the undetected neutrino would have
 half-integer spin, a quantum mechanical property of matter, since the observed
 particles in 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay did not conserve angular momentum.
 The existence of the neutrino and validation of Pauli's predictions would
 not be experimentally verified for another 20 years.

\begin_layout Standard
The neutrino was first observed in 1953 by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines
 using a nuclear reactor in South Carolina, United States of America.
 Since then three types or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of neutrinos and antineutrinos have been observed using accelerators and
 also from unique sources like the Sun and a supernova.
 Neutrino physics continues to be an active area of fundamental research
 since the neutrino is a truly unique probe to subatomic processes.
 For instance they are observed to originate from the depths of the Sun's
 core (over 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{7}$
\end_inset

 degrees Kelvin) where fusion occurs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, meaning that they travel essential
ly unimpeded towards one's particle detector.
 The rarity of such interactions can be illustrated by the fact that over
 a typical human lifetime, only one solar neutrino interaction with an individua
l is expected out of the 
\begin_inset Formula $7.0\times10^{10}\text{ neutrinos}/\text{cm}^{2}/\text{sec}$
\end_inset

 incident on the Earth.

To give some perspective to this number, this means 70 billion neutrinos
 are traveling every second through an area similar to one's own thumb nail.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 So this begs the question: how does one detect a neutrino? The short answer
 is that one requires a large enough flux of neutrinos passing through a
 large dense volume of matter just to detect a single neutrino with today's
 technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientists continue to be interested in neutrinos due to the unusual properties
 they exhibit.
 One of the more recent and surprising aspects of neutrinos is their ability
 to undergo 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavor oscillations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where a neutrino of definite flavor (type) is created and later observed
 as a different flavor.
 The impact of differences between neutrino and antineutrino oscillations
 could help explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe
 which one of the most profound mysteries in physics today.

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is the theory of elementary
 or fundamental particle constituents and the forces between them.
 These forces are the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong.
 String theory, which is not yet tested, attempts to incorporate the gravitation
al force.
 The SM forces and the gravitational force constitute the four

 fundamental forces of the Universe.
 Each force in the SM has at least one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 particle that mediates the interactions between the matter particles.
 The force carriers are formally called

gauge bosons
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, which indicates that they are particles with integer 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1,2,...)$

 The weak nuclear gauge bosons, the charged

The Elementary Particles of the Standard Model of Particle Physics
\end_layout

\end_inset

The Standard Model of particle physics consists of six quarks (up, down,
 strange, charm, bottom, and top), six leptons (electron, muon, tau, electron
 neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino), four force propagating bosons
 (gluon, photon, W, and Z), and the Higgs boson.
 The quarks, electron, muon, tau, W, and Z all gain mass through the Higgs
 field.
 The focus of this thesis are the neutrinos which are classified according
 to their charged, more massive Lepton cousins.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A gauge theory describes ways to measure physical forces or fields through
 interactions between elementary particles.
 The electric or magnetic fields for example can only be probed by charged
 particles.
 In the realm of quantum field theories, fields are postulated to permeate
 everywhere and it is excitations of these fields that produce experimental
 observables.
 Fields are constructed using the Lagrangian formalism and altered using
 gauge transformations.
 If altering the Lagrangian in some way does not affect the observables,
 this is referred to as a gauge invariance.
 Local gauge invariance means that under the constraints of the experiment,
 certain gauge transformations do not affect the observables.
 The allowed locally gauge invariant transformations require knowledge of
 its underlying Lie, or symmetry, group.
 With the weak isospin doublets, the Lie groups are SU(2)
\begin_inset Formula $\bigotimes$
\end_inset

U(1) where SU(2) is the special unitary group of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$

 unitary matrices, and U(1) is the unitary (circle) group consisting of
 complex numbers of magnitude 1.

\begin_layout Standard
The name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weak force
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from the fact that this force is much weaker than the electromagnetic
 and strong nuclear forces.
 This is due to the weak mediating bosons, the 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

, being massive particles unlike the massless gluon (g) and photon (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{\pm}/Z$
\end_inset

 have masses of 80/90 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{GeV/c}^{2}$
\end_inset

, which is more massive than all the other elementary particles except for
 the top quark.

For weak interactions to occur at energies far below the masses (also called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of the 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

, the interaction time must be infinitesimally small as dictated by the
 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta E\Delta t\gtrsim\hbar\label{eq:heisenberguncertainty}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E$
\end_inset

 is the energy of the particle and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is the time during which the particle exists.
 As an example, consider a neutrino emitting a Z-boson as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 If the energy of the neutrino is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 GeV, the lifetime of the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 boson is about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-25}$
\end_inset

 seconds according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In general, the probability that a massive particle of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 will be created from the collision of two particles is given by a relativistic
 Breit–Wigner distribution
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(M)\propto\frac{1}{\left(M^{2}-M_{0}^{2}\right)^{2}c^{4}+M_{0}^{2}\Gamma^{2}},\label{eq:BreitWigner}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the rest mass and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is the decay width of the particle.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $M\ll M_{0}$
\end_inset

, the probability of creating that particle will be infinitesimally small.
 Therefore to observe a single weak interaction requires a large number
 of weakly interacting particles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weak interactions are classified into two classes: charged current (CC)
 and neutral current (NC).
 The CC interactions involve a charged W boson and changes the incident
 neutrino into an electrically charged lepton of flavor 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 where the flavor of the neutrino 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{l}$
\end_inset

 is inferred from the charged lepton.
 The same is not true for NC interactions, in which the exchange a neutral
 Z boson occurs.
 The NC interactions are flavor agnostic since they do not produce a charged
 lepton nor change the neutrino's flavor.
 An example of each interaction type is shown in

Neutrinos are observed to have their spin direction vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 opposite to their momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P}$
\end_inset

 and this is reversed for antineutrinos.
 This property is called helicity and is given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}=\frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{P}}{\left|\boldsymbol{P}\right|}.\label{eq:helicityoperator}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Although neutrino detection is difficult, the neutrino helicity is readily
 inferred from the daughter muon's helicity in pion decay, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pion^{+}\rightarrow\mu^{+}+\numu$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\muplus$
\end_inset

 has negative helicity (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}=-1$
\end_inset

) and to converse spin, the neutrino's helicity must also be negative as
 shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:DecayOfPion"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The antineutrino's helicity is positive (+1) as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:DecayOfPion"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 through use of the charge (C) conjugation and parity (P) transformations.
 A C conjugation is a linear transformation that transforms all particles
 into their corresponding antiparticles while the P transformation inverts
 all spatial coordinates.
 Thus neutrinos are referred to as 
\shape italic
left-handed

 (LH) particles while antineutrinos are referred to as

 (RH) particles.
 It turns out that helicity is a useful quantum number to describe neutrinos
 and coincides with a property called chirality.
 To understand chirality and its relationship to helicity requires an analysis
 of the Dirac Lagrangian and Dirac equation.

The observation of only LH neutrinos and RH antineutrinos is an important

 However, since neutrinos are known to have mass, given that neutrinos oscillate

 That would require boosting to a highly relativistic reference frame with

 The

 The CC-DIS interaction is a high energy transfer process that shatters

 interactions refer to processes where a post-FSI charged pion is experimentally
 observed presumably from the decay of resonance state like the

\begin_layout Standard
Neutrino oscillations is the physical process of a neutrino produced with
 a particular, definite flavor and later observed as a different flavor.
 This phenomenon was first observed as a deficit of neutrinos for a number
 of atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments.
 The deficit also seemed more pronounced for atmospheric neutrinos as the
 distance from their source increased.
 For neutrino oscillations to occur, at most one neutrino can be massless.
 This observation firmly established that the SM is incorrect with its assumptio
n of massless neutrinos.
\end_layout

 Mine experiment

 which began operation in the 1960s.
 Ray Davis was an expert chemist and designed a radiochemical experiment
 to measure the flux of neutrinos from sun.
 The purpose of this experiment was to test John Bahcall's prediction of
 the fusion rate in the Sun and neutrino flux from it as well.
 Davis' experiment would need to operate for many years to collect enough
 statistics due to expected low capture rate.
 Measurements continued into the 1980s and showed that the flux of neutrinos
 was about 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 the expected rate and this became known as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Solar Neutrino Problem.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The primary explainations were either that the solar model was incorrect
 or the neutrino capture cross section was incorrect.
 The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was able to resolve this problem
 by making a model-independent measurement of the solar neutrino flux.
 SNO observed a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nue$
\end_inset

 CC-to-NC ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.301\pm0.033$
\end_inset

, which confirmed that only about 30% of neutrinos arrive as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nue$

 flavors on Earth.
 In other words, the majority of neutrinos arrive as the wrong flavor

Another outstanding problem emerged with measurements of atmospheric neutrinos,
 in particular muon and electron types.
 Atmospheric neutrinos are produced when high energy cosmic rays strike
 atmospheric particles.
 These cosmic ray collisions generate mostly pions and kaons that decay
 into neutrinos.
 When trying to measure the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu/\nue$
\end_inset

 ratio, there was another significant deficit.
 This was particularly apparent for the Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment,
 which is a 50 kt tank of pure water lined with thousands of photomultiplier
 tubes designed to observe solar and atmospheric neutrinos.
 It was the first experiment to perform a neutrino oscillation analysis
 that successfully explained the deficit.

 However, oscillations between flavored neutrinos was not expected since
 it requires the neutrino to have mass.

The terminology of

 should be more apparent now since 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:prob2flavorsimplified"

\end_inset

 demonstrates that the probability changes sinusoidally as a function of
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 This equation is not, however, terribly useful in the laboratory frame
 since it is hard to design an experiment where the travel time an individual
 neutrino is actually measured.
 Since neutrinos are nearly massless, they travel very close to the speed
 of light.
 Therefore time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is replaced with 
\begin_inset Formula $L/c$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the distance between the neutrino origin and detection and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is now the speed of light in vacuum.
 One can also approximate the energy of the mass eigenstate as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}E_{j} & =\left(m_{j}^{2}c^{4}+p_{j}^{2}c^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}=p_{j}c\left(1+\frac{m_{j}^{2}c^{2}}{p_{j}^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
 & \approx p_{j}c\left(1+\frac{m_{j}^{2}c^{2}}{2p_{j}^{2}}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m_{j}c}{p_{j}}\right)^{4}\right)\\
 & \approx E_{\nu}+\frac{m_{j}^{2}c^{4}}{2E_{\nu}},
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:enuapprox}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where for oscillation experiments 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}\gg m_{j}c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}c\approx E_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the neutrino energy as measured in the laboratory.
 Substituting these assumptions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the oscillation probability is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathcal{\mathcal{P}}\left(\nu_{\alpha}\rightarrow\nu_{\beta}\right) & =\sin^{2}(2\theta)\sin^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta m^{2}c^{3}}{4\hbar}\frac{L}{E_{\nu}}\right),\end{aligned}
\label{eq:prob2flavorapprox}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta m^{2}=m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the mass-squared difference between the mass states.
 For a moment consider evaluating all the physical constants in natural

\end_inset

 The oscillation probability from between states

\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

which more clearly illustrates the physics of neutrino oscillations.
 The oscillation probability has an amplitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin^{2}(2\theta)$
\end_inset

 and varies with frequency inversely proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta m^{2}$

 as shown in

 Since

In the general case of oscillations using a

\end_inset

 mixing matrix, the unitary transformation can be written as a rotation
 matrix with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{n}{2}(n-1)$
\end_inset

 weak mixing angles with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-1)$
\end_inset

 Charge-Parity (CP) violating phases.
 In addition, oscillations are dictated by a total of

\end_inset

 mass-squared splittings
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This all assumes that neutrinos obey the Dirac Equation, or that they are
 not their own antiparticles.
 The favored mixing model is a 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix since there are three known neutrino flavors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nue$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nutau$

 This means that there are three (3) mixing angles, one (1) CP violating
 phase, and three (3) mass-squared splittings.

 CP violating terms must be odd function of

Electron Neutrino Appearance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous subsection briefly explored the muon disappearance probability,
 which is not tested as a channel for CP violation.
 Electron neutrino appearance, however, does provide insight into CP violation
 in the lepton sector.
 The appearance probability of electron neutrino types from muon neutrino
 types is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathcal{P}\left(\nuantinuparticle{\mu}\rightarrow\nuantinuparticle e\right)= & 4\ccc{13}\sss{13}\sss{23}\sin^{2}\phi_{31}\\

\end{aligned}
\label{eq:numu2nuethreeflavorfull}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{\cos\delta_{\text{CP}}}=\ccc{13}\ss{12}\ss{13}\ss{23}\left(\cc{12}\cc{23}\cos\delta_{\text{CP}}-\ss{12}\ss{13}\right)\label{eq:Xcosdelta}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{\sin\delta_{\text{CP}}}=\frac{1}{8}\sin\left(2\theta_{12}\right)\sin\left(2\theta_{13}\right)\sin\left(2\theta_{23}\right)\cc{13}\sin\delta_{\text{CP}}\label{eq:Ysindelta}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and (+) represents the sign change from neutrinos to antineutrinos.
 The CP violating term 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is also known as the Jarlskog Invariant and is a measure of CP violation
 independent of the mixing parameterization
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This oscillation channel is of primary importance in current and future
 proposed accelerator and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current and next generation experiments aim to improve knowledge of the
 mixing parameters.
 There are a couple of degeneracies to unravel as well as precise measurement
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\deltacp$
\end_inset

 While the two defined mass-squared splittings 
\begin_inset Formula $\Dm 21=\Delta m_{\text{sol}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Dm 32=\Delta m_{\text{atm}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are known, it is unknown which eigenstates are more massive.
 This problem is known as the mass hierarchy problem and is illustrated
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Mass-hierarchy"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Normal hierarchy refers to the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{3}>m_{2}>m_{1}$
\end_inset

 whereas the inverted hierarchy has 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}>m_{1}>m_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Also distinguishing if 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{23}$

\end_inset

 or second octant 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\in(\nicefrac{\pi}{2},\nicefrac{\pi}{4})$
\end_inset

 of the unit circle requires large statistics.
 Finally the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\deltacp$
\end_inset

 is quite uncertain with values in the 3rd and 4th quadrants.

The KEK to Kamioka (K2K) experiment was the first neutrino oscillation experimen
t where researchers controlled the production and observation of neutrinos.
 In K2K, a beam of muon neutrinos were directed from the 12 GeV proton synchotro
n at KEK to the Kamioka Observatory at a distance of 250 km.
 While travelling through the Earth, the neutrinos oscillate before they
 are observed at Kamioka.
 Prior to K2K, neutrino sources included the atmosphere, the Sun, and one
 supernova.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The K2K experiment established the experimental methods for current and
 planned next generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments
 from accelerators.
 The accelerator neutrinos are produced when a high energy proton beam hits
 a target.
 The secondary particles are then forward focused using electrically pulsed
 magnets and allowed to decay in a large decay volume.
 This procedure produces a highly pure muon neutrino beam with order 1%
 electron neutrino contamination.
 Prior to any oscillations, a

 To generate the high intensity neutrino beam, first the linear accelerator

 The RCS then injects some of its protons into the 50 GeV Synchrotron (yellow)
 called the main ring (MR), which currently runs at 30 GeV.
 Finally the MR protons are directed into a target material along the neutrino
 beamline (teal)

 Each linac element, except for the initial quadrapole magnet, accelerates
 the ions using carefully synchronized oscillating electric fields generated
 by radio frequency pulses.
 After traveling 240 m along the linac, the ions have been boosted to 181
 MeV of kinetic energy and transported into the RCS.
 While in transit to the RCS, the ions are stripped of their electrons via
 charge stripping foils.
 The 348 m circumference RCS then further boosts the protons to 3 GeV at
 an operating frequency of 25 Hz.
 While being accelerated, protons are aggregated into two bunches and focused
 using particle collimators as shown in

In order to provide timing information for the neutrino beam at SK, a global

 Any event outside the beam timing window is rejected in the T2K oscillation

 is critical for the experiment.
 The GPS has an internal accuracy of 50 ns, or about

T2K has a near detector (ND) site at J-PARC that is designed specifically
 to observe the neutrino beam in flight aimed at Super-K.
 The primary purpose of a ND site is to 
\shape italic
constrain the neutrino flux and interaction rate
\shape default
 at SK in order to reduce the impact of their systematic uncertainties on
 the oscillation analysis.
 The analysis in this thesis uses the data collected by the off-axis ND.
 The site is called ND280 and is located 280m away from the production target.
 The primary detector is an off-axis, magnetized tracking detector consisting
 of different subdetectors.
 A separate detector array called the Interactive Neutrino Grid (INGRID)
 measures the neutrino beam profile.
 Both on-axis and off-axis detectors extensively utilize a commercial light
 sensor called a multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) for the light collection
 in the scintillator-based detectors.

 Next is a description of INGRID and its purpose at ND280.
 This is followed by a general description primary off-axis, magnetized
 detector.
 The last two subsections are descriptions of two primary subdetectors in
 the off axis detector.

The on-axis near detector called the Interactive Neutrino Grid (INGRID)
 is a tracking scintillator detector designed to directly measure the neutrino

 As shown in

, it is a cross grid of tracking modules centered at the designed neutrino
 beam center (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=0$
\end_inset

).
 Each module consists of alternating layers of iron plates and scintillator
 bars except for the two most downstream scintillating layers which lack
 iron plates.
 To monitor any beam asymmetry, two separate modules are placed off the
 grid axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each scintillating bar consists of scintillator-doped polystyrene which
 emits light when a charged particle deposits energy in the media.
 Each bar contains a single wavelength-shifting (WLS) fiber to collect and
 shift the light to a different energy.
 The light from the fiber is then collected using a device called a multipixel
 photon counter (MPPC) and converted into an electrical signal.
 A MPPC is a compact device containing many sensitive avalanche photodiode
 pixels that act as Geiger micro-counters as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The MPPCs are well matched with the spectral emission of the WSL fibers
 and operate in a strong magnetic fields, unlike traditional photomultiplier
 tubes.
 In order to enhance the collection efficiency, a reflective

ND280 consists of the pi-zero detector (
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

), the tracker region consisting of a fine grain detector (FGD) and time
 projection chamber (TPC), an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal), and side
 muon range detector (SMRD).
 The ND280 subdetectors are instrumented inside the recycled UA1/NOMAD magnet
 with the SMRD in the magnetic field return yoke itself.
 All but the FGD is instrumented with the same scintillating-bar bar technology
 collected by MPPCs.
 A schematic of the different detector components of ND280 is shown in

This is a powerful magnetic field.
 According to the The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2015-2020, the magnetic
 field strength on the surface of the Earth is about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.294385$
\end_inset

 Gauss or 
\begin_inset Formula $2.94385\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 T.
 So the field inside ND280 is about 6800 times more forceful than the Earth's
 influence
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 in the x direction.
 The field is highly uniform near the center of the detector which is where
 the majority of the TPC system is located.
 However, it has significant deviations from 0.2 T near the solenoid edges.
 In order to fully understand the field inside ND280, a precise 3D model
 was generated using a machine controlled Hall probe.
 The operating field strength during the mapping process was 0.07 T due to
 power restrictions at the time.
 The model was then compared with measurements in the TPC region as shown
 in

 After scaling the model to the nominal operating strength of 0.2 T, a fractional
 uncertainty of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$

 or uncertainty of 2 Gauss in each direction was obtained.

The ND280 magnetic field permits the measurements of particle charge and
 momentum.
 A particle of charge 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

, rest mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset

, and velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 under the influence of an external electric and magnetic fields, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

, respectively, experiences a force 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 given by the Lorentz force equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}=q\left(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\right).\label{eq:Lorentzforce}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Assuming for now that there is no external electric field, the force on
 the particle is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B},\label{eq:LorentzforceNoE}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is both orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the mechanical work on a particle in a magnetic field is zero, the
 particle's energy is unchanged (
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{v}\right|$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 = constant).
 Newton's Second Law allows us to rewrite the force as an change in momentum
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathbf{F} & =\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt}\\
 & =\frac{d}{dt}\left(\gamma(v)m_{0}\mathbf{v}\right)\\
 & =m_{0}\mathbf{v}\left(\frac{d\gamma(v)}{dt}\right)+\gamma(v)m_{0}\left(\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}\right)\\
 & =m_{0}\mathbf{v}\left(\frac{d\gamma(v)}{dv}\right)\cancelto{0}{\left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)}+\gamma(v)m_{0}\mathbf{a}\\
 & =\gamma(v)m_{0}\mathbf{\mathbf{a}},
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:relativisticforceInBfield}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P=\gamma}(v)m_{0}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is the relativistic momentum and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(v)=\left(1-\left(v/c\right)^{2}\right)^{\nicefrac{-1}{2}}$
\end_inset

 is the Lorentz factor for relativistic particles.
 For uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the acceleration is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\mathbf{a}\right|=v^{2}/R,\label{eq:uniformcircularmotion}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where R is the radius of curvature for the circle.
 Combining

 with some algebra yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R=\frac{\gamma(v)m_{0}v}{q\left|\mathbf{B}\right|\sin\theta_{\mathbf{vB}}},\label{eq:radiusofcurvature}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mathbf{vB}}$
\end_inset

 is the angle between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 The numerator of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is recognized as the magnitude of the momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{P}\right|$
\end_inset

 Some further rearrangement yields

\begin{equation}
\left|\mathbf{P}\right|=q\left|\mathbf{B}\right|R\sin\theta_{\mathbf{vB}},\label{eq:momentuminmagneticfield}

and thus measuring the direction and radius of curvature inside the field
 provides the charge and momentum, respectively, as desired.

The readout electronics for the

 among the SMRD, ECals, and INGRID.
 Signals from 64 MPPCs are routed to Trip-T front end boards (TFB) that
 each house 4 Trip-T ASICs.
 Each Trip-T collects the MPPC charge in 23 programmable integration cycles.

The TFB are readout to back-end electronics which control the TFBs and synchroni

 A total of six readout merger module (RMM) electronics receive TFB the
 data and control each TFB ASIC.
 RMM timing are synchronized with a cosmic trigger module and a slave clock
 module (SCM), of which both are synchronized with a master clock module
 from the beamline.
 Synchronizing the RMMs with the SCM allows for the Trip-T ASIC integration
 windows to match with the beam.
 The RMMs are responsible for distributing the TFB data to the data acquisition
 (DAQ) system for storage.

\begin_layout Standard
The ND280 DAQ consists of a MIDAS framework to monitor and control data

 temperatures, voltages, and other physical quantities.
 Together the DAQ and GSC help scientists consistently produce high quality

As charged particles traverse the inner TPC volume, they create ionization
 electrons in the gas which drift towards readout planes away from a central
 cathode.
 The electron drift acceleration is rapid due to the strong 5 kV/cm electric
 field present.
 Drift electrons are multiplied and sampled by micromega detectors that
 line the sides of the TPC, providing nearly 3

Track Reconstruction in ND280

 Since this analysis uses neutrino events incident in the

 needed.

When charged particles travel through the water, a Cherenkov radiation cone
 is produced.
 The sharpness of the cone edge is an unique ID for the particle species
 that produced it.
 An electron produces a fuzzy edge since it experiences many large multiple
 scatterings off the water molecules.
 A muon on the other hand produces a sharp edge since it is much more massive
 and thus less perturbed by the water molecules.

Contributions to the T2K Experiment

\begin_layout Standard
Since joining the T2K experiment five years ago, I have played a critical
 role in analysis that is currently in preparation for publication.
 This analysis was a second generation measurement of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

 CC single pion production cross section on water in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

.
 I am a co-author of that paper and its internal T2K technical document
 that outlines the analysis procedure and studies.
 In particular, I have contributed to data management, reconstructed kinematic
 validation and characterization, observable feature engineering to describe
 events in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

, and cross validation of complex event selections using boosted random
 forest classifiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outside of analysis work, the majority of my contributions to the experiment
 include on-site 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 and ND280 expertise.
 I was involved in the 2015 work to replace two 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 water bags when they showed evidence of leaking.
 Additionally, I helped measure the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 water mass and its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bulging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 due to the water.
 During data taking periods, I signed up at least once a year to perform
 shifts.
 I am certified as a TTD expert, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 water system and calibration expert, and experienced DAQ shifter.
 As TTD and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 expert, this included daily reporting and point of contact for the SMRD,
 ECals, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 along with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

 water target system whenever problems arose.
 My most recent contribution was participating in the 2018 Super-K open
 tank work at the Kamioka Observatory.
 That work included removing any found oxidation, diesel fumes from the
 initial construction, and glass shards remaining after a significant multi-PMT
 implosion in 2001.
 When not cleaning, the other important task was to install light-tight
 Tyvek sheets to insulate the inner detector.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The neutrino is an elusive particle to detect.
 The relatively new neutrino oscillation phenomenon has opened up the possibilit
y of exploring fundamental questions of the Universe like CP violation.
 In the T2K experiment, some of the uncertainties associated with neutrino
 oscillations are being explored.
 To facilitate these goals, constraining all forms of uncertainty in neutrino-nu
clear interactions and flux help improve its sensitivity to the oscillation
 predictions.

The next chapters in this thesis are presented in the following order.
 First is the ND280 constraint on the flux and cross section models using
 the BANFF maximum likelihood fit.
 Next is the description of the analysis samples that are used in the BANFF
 fit.
 With the samples defined, the parameterization of the fit bins and penalty
 terms are defined for this analysis.
 This is followed by the validation of the BANFF fit in a few scenarios.
 Then the BANFF postfit results will be analyzed in relation to previous
 analyses.
 The final chapter is a discussion of the results and prospects for the
 future.
