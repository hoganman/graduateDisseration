Introduction to Neutrinos

The history of the neutrino can be traced back to electron energy spectrum

-Decay.
 While measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

-decay of atomic nuclei showed discreate spectral lines, the electron (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 particle) exhibited a continous energy spectrum.
 Experimentally, there were two observed particles in each decay process
 and classical physics dictated that the outgoing daughter particles should
 have discrete energies.
 The fact that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

-decay sprectrum was not this way possed a fundamental problem for physicists
 in the mid-1910s and later, was energy conserved? Two solutions were postulated
: either the

energy conservation law is only valid statistically in such a process [...]
 or an additional undetectable new particle [...] carrying away the additional
 energy and spin [...] is emitted

 The latter solution was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in a letter to a group
 of physicists meeting in TÃ¼bingen, modern Germany dated 4 December 1930
 where he called his proposed neutral particle a

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, what we would call a neutrino today.
 Pauli's solution also predicted that the undetected neutrino would have
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

-spin, a quantum mechanical property of matter, since the observed particles
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay did not conserve angular momentum.
 The existance of the neutrino and validation of Pauli's predictions would
 not experimentally verified for another 20 years.
