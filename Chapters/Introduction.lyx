The history of the neutrino can be traced back to electron energy spectrum
 observed in neutron 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay.
 While measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

-decay of atomic nuclei showed discrete spectral lines, the electron (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 particle) exhibited a continuous energy spectrum.
 Experimentally, there were two observed particles in each decay process
 and classical physics dictated that the outgoing daughter particles should
 have discrete energies.
 The fact that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay spectrum was not this way posed a fundamental problem for physicists
 in the mid-1910s and later, was energy conserved? Two solutions were postulated
: either the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

energy conservation law is only valid statistically in such a process [...]
 or an additional undetectable new particle [...] carrying away the additional
 energy and spin [...] is emitted

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The latter solution was supported by Wolfgang Pauli in a letter dated 4
 December 1930 to a group of physicists meeting in Tübingen, modern Germany,
 where he first proposed the neutrino

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In W Pauli's December 1930 letter, he referred to his proposed particle
 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutron
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is not the same neutron known of today.
 At that point in time, the neutral particles inside the atomic nucleus,
 also called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutrons
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, had not been discovered, let alone understood.
 The neutron, which was discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick, has been formally
 associated as the neutral, cousin particle to the proton.
 It would be Enrico Fermi who would coin the particle in W Pauli's letter
 and solution to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

.
 Pauli's solution also predicted that the undetected neutrino would have
 half-integer spin, a quantum mechanical property of matter, since the observed
 particles in 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-decay did not conserve angular momentum.
 The existence of the neutrino and validation of Pauli's predictions would
 not experimentally verified for another 20 years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The neutrino was first discovered in 1953 by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines
 using a nuclear reactor in South Carolina, U.S.A..
 Since then three types of neutrinos have been observed and from unique
 sources like the Sun and a supernova.
 Neutrino physics continues to be an active region of physics since neutrinos
 are unique probes to processes otherwise inaccessible in laboratories.
 For instance in the depths of the Sun's core where fusion occurs and neutrinos
 are created, neutrinos are able to travel through the ultra dense and hot
 medium of the core (over 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{7}$
\end_inset

 degrees Kelvin) and outer layers of the Sun and reach us on Earth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, meaning that they travel essential
ly unimpeded towards one's particle detector.
 The rarity of such interactions can be illustrated with the fact that given
 nearly 
\begin_inset Formula $7.0\times10^{10}\text{ neutrinos}/\text{cm}^{2}/\text{sec}$
\end_inset

 are incident on the Earth from the Sun

To give some perspective to this number, this means 70 billion neutrinos
 are traveling every second through an area similar to one's own thumb nail.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

, statistically one solar neutrino can harmlessly interact with an individual
 in her lifetime.
 So this begs the question: how does one detect a neutrino? The short answer
 is one needs a ultra large volume of matter and a large enough flux of
 neutrinos in its path just to detect one given today's technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientists continue to be interested in neutrinos due to properties they
 exhibit.
 One of the more recent and surprising aspects about neutrinos is their
 ability to undergo 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavor oscillations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where a neutrino of definite flavor (type) is created and later observed
 as a different flavor.
 The impact of such oscillations could help explain the observed matter
 and anti-matter asymmetry in the Universe.

The Standard Model of particle physics
\end_layout

\end_inset

The Standard Model of particle physics consists of six quarks (up, down,
 strange, charm, bottom, and top), six leptons (electron, muon, tau, electron
 neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino), four force propagating bosons
 (gluon, photon, W, and Z), and the Higgs boson.
 The quarks, electron, muon, tau, W, and Z all gain mass through the Higgs
 field.
 The focus of this thesis are the neutrinos which are classified according
 to their charged, more massive Lepton cousins.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A gauge theory describes ways to measure physical forces or fields through
 interactions between elementary particles.
 The electric or magnetic fields for example can only be probed by charged
 particles.
 In the realm of quantum field theories, fields are postulated to permeate
 everywhere and it is excitations of these fields which produce experimental
 observables.
 Fields are constructed using the Lagrangian formalism and altered using
 gauge transformations.
 If altering the Lagrangian in some way does not affect the observables,
 this is referred to as a gauge invariance.
 Local gauge invariance means that under the constraints of the experiment,
 certain gauge transformations do not affect the observables.
 The allowed locally gauge invariant transformations require knowledge of
 its underlying Lie, or symmetry, group.
 With the weak isospin doublets, the Lie groups are SU(2)
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

U(1) where SU(2) is the special unitary group of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$

 unitary matrices, and U(1) is the unitary (circle) group consisting of
 complex numbers of magnitude 1.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weak force
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from the fact that this force is has a much smaller effective range
 than the electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and gravitational forces.
 This is due to the weak mediating bosons, the 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

, being massive particles unlike the massless gluon (g) and photon (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $W/Z$
\end_inset

 have masses of 80/90 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{GeV/c}^{2}$
\end_inset

, which is more massive than all the elementary particles except for the
 top quark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For weak interactions to occur at energies far below the masses (also called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

off-shell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of the 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

, the interaction time must be infinitesimally small as dictated by the
 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta E\Delta t\gtrsim\hbar\label{eq:heisenberguncertainty}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E$
\end_inset

 is the energy of the particle and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is the time which the particle exists.
 As an example, consider a neutrino of energy of 1 GeV emitting a Z-boson
 of off-shell energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E=1$
\end_inset

 GeV like shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The lifetime of that boson is about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-25}$
\end_inset

 seconds according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 In general, the probability that a massive particle of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 will be created from the collision of two particles is given by a relativistic
 Breit–Wigner distribution
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(M)\propto\frac{1}{\left(\left(M^{2}-M_{0}^{2}\right)c^{4}\right)^{2}+\left(M_{0}c^{2}\Gamma\right)^{2}},\label{eq:BreitWigner}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the rest mass and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is the decay width of the particle in units of energy.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $M\ll M_{0}$
\end_inset

, the probability of creating that particle will be infinitesimally small.
 Therefore to observe a single weak interaction requires a large amount
 of weakly interacting particles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weak interactions are classified into two classes of interactions: charged
 current (CC) and neutral current (NC).
 CC interactions involve a charged W boson and change the scattering neutrino
 into a electrically charged lepton of flavor 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 where the flavor of the neutrino 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{l}$
\end_inset

 is inferred from the charged lepton.
 The same cannot be said of NC interactions which exchange a neutral Z boson.
 NC interactions are flavor agnostic since they do not produce a charged
 lepton.
 An example of each interaction type is shown in

Chirality: How Neutrinos are Left Handed
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Neutrinos are observed to have anti-parallel momentum vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P}$
\end_inset

 to their spin vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$
\end_inset

 and the opposite is true for anti-neutrinos.
 This property is called helicity and is given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:helicityoperator"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}=\frac{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{P}}{\left|\boldsymbol{P}\right|}.\label{eq:helicityoperator}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

While detecting neutrinos is hard as it is, the helicity is inferred from
 the daughter muon in charged pion decay.
 Since a pion has net zero (0) spin, the spin vectors of the daughters must
 also sum to zero.
 The muon from a 
\begin_inset Formula $\pion^{+}$
\end_inset

 decay has negative helicity (-1) hence the neutrino also has negative helicity.
 To confirm the anti-neutrino's helicity is positive (+1), the interaction
 requires both a charge (C) conjugation and parity (P) transformation as
 shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:DecayOfPion"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 A C conjugation is a linear transformation that transforms all particles
 into their corresponding antiparticles while the P transformation inverts
 all spatial coordinates.
 Thus neutrinos are referred to 
\shape italic
left-handed
\shape default
 (LH) particles while anti-neutrinos are 
\shape italic
right-handed
\shape default
 (RH) particles.
 It turns out helicity is a useful quantum number to describe neutrinos
 and coincides with a property called chirality.
 To understand chirality and its relationship to helicity requires an analysis
 of the Dirac Lagrangian and Dirac equation.

 Since a pion at rest has zero (0) angular momentum, the system of daughter
 particles must have net zero angular momentum as well.
 A neutrino (antineutrino) is a right- (left-) handed helicity particle
 since its spin is (anti-)parallel to its momentum.
 Application of charge and parity (CP) converts all the particles into their

The Dirac Lagrangian for a free particle field 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(x\right)$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\overline{\psi}\left(x\right)\left[\frac{i\hbar}{2}\sum_{\mu=0}^{3}\gamma^{\mu}\left(\overrightarrow{\partial_{\mu}}-\overleftarrow{\partial_{\mu}}\right)-mc\right]\psi\left(x\right)\label{eq:diraclagrangian}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is a four-component vector (spinor) describing a particle field and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are a set of four 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 matrices.
 The adjoint field 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\psi}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\psi}\left(x\right)\equiv\psi^{\dagger}\left(x\right)\gamma^{0}\label{eq:adjointfield}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\dagger$
\end_inset

 denotes the conjugate and transpose operations.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{\partial_{\mu}}$
\end_inset

 operator is a four-vector defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{0}=\frac{1}{c}\partderiv t,\partial_{1}=\partderiv x,\partial_{2}=\partderiv y,\partial_{3}=\partderiv z\label{eq:fourderivative}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

that acts only on the right of it while 
\begin_inset Formula $\overleftarrow{\partial_{\mu}}$
\end_inset

 only acts on its left (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\psi}\overleftarrow{\partial_{\mu}}=\partial_{\mu}\overline{\psi}$
\end_inset

).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 matrices are not unique and different representations dictate different
 kinematic regimes.
 The field equations are extracted from the Lagrangian using the Euler-Lagrange
 procedure.
 In general for a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 fields, the field equation are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\mu}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_{\mu}\psi_{r}\right)}-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\psi_{r}}=0\quad\left(r=0,1,2,\ldots,M-1,M\right).\label{eq:eulerlagrangegeneral}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 For the Dirac Lagrangian, the field equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\mu}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_{\mu}\overline{\psi}\right)}-\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\overline{\psi}}=0\label{eq:diracELequation}

\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}$

i & 0
\end{pmatrix},\quad\sigma_{z}=\sigma_{3}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Using the Chiral representation, the chirality matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{5}$
\end_inset

 (the fifth gamma matrix), is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\gamma^{5}=i\gamma^{0}\gamma^{1}\gamma^{2}\gamma^{3}=\begin{bmatrix}I_{2} & 0\\
0 & -I_{2}
\end{bmatrix},\label{eq:gammafivedef}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is diagonal as well as Hermitian meaning that its eigenvalues are
 real and observable.
 Let eigenfunctions of the chirality matrix be denoted with subscripts 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

\begin_layout Standard
The observation of only LH neutrinos and RH anti-neutrinos is an important
 feature in the SM.
 However, since neutrinos are known to have mass from oscillations, it is
 theoretically possible to observe a RH neutrino and LH anti-neutrino.
 That would require boosting to a highly relativistic reference frame with
 respect to the laboratory.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neutrino oscillations are the observation of a neutrino produced of definite
 flavor and later observed as a different flavor.
 This phenomenon was first observed as a deficit of neutrinos for a number
 of atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments.
 The deficit also seemed more pronounced for atmospheric neutrinos as the
 distance from their source increased.
 For neutrino oscillations to occur, at least one neutrino must be massive.
 This observation firmly established that the SM is wrong with its prediction
 of massless neutrinos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first indication of neutrino oscillations was from the Ray Davis Homesteak
 Mine experiment which began in the 1960s.
 Ray Davis was an expert Chemist and designed a radiochemical experiment
 to measure the flux of neutrinos from Sun.
 The purpose of this experiment was to test John Bahcall's prediction of
 the fusion rate in the Sun and neutrino flux from it as well.
 Davis' experiment would need to operate for many years to collect enough
 statistics due to expected low capture rate.
 Measurements continued into the 1980s and showed that the flux of neutrinos
 as measured at Homesteak was about 1/3 the expected rate and became known
 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Solar Neutrino Problem.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The primary solutions were either the the solar model was incorrect or
 the neutrino capture cross section is incorrect somehow.
 The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was able to resolve this problem
 by making a model-independent measurement of the solar neutrino flux.
 SNO observed a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nue$
\end_inset

CC-to-NC ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.301\pm0.033$
\end_inset

, which confirmed that only about 30% of neutrinos arrive as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nue$
\end_inset

 flavors on Earth.
 Saying this another way, the majority of neutrinos arrive as the wrong
 flavor

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another outstanding problem emerged with measurements of atmospheric neutrinos,
 in particular muon and electron types.
 Atmospheric neutrinos are produced when high energy cosmic rays strike
 atmospheric particles.
 These cosmic ray collisions generate mostly pions and kaons that decay
 into neutrinos.
 When trying to measure the 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu/\nue$
\end_inset

 ratio and comparing that with expected ratio, there was another significant
 deficit.
 This was particularly a problem as a function of the zenith angle for the
 Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment.
 SK is a 50kt tank of pure water lined with thousands of photomultiplier
 tubes designed to observe solar and atmospheric neutrinos.
 It was the first experiment to perform a neutrino oscillation analysis
 that successfully explained the deficit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations has been understood for almost
 three decades, it was not predicted since oscillations require the neutrino
 has mass.
 The reasons why neutrino oscillations require massive neutrinos are explained

In the general case of oscillations using a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 mixing matrix, the unitary transformation can be written as a rotation
 matrix with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{n}{2}(n-1)$
\end_inset

 weak mixing angles with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-1)$
\end_inset

 Charge-Parity (CP) violating phases.
 In addition, oscillations are dictated by a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 mass-squared splittings
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This all assumes that neutrinos obey the Dirac Equation, or that they are
 not their own antiparticles.
 The favored mixing model is the 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix since there are three known neutrino flavors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nue$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\numu$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nutau$
\end_inset

.
 This means that there are three (3) mixing angles, one (1) CP violating
 phase, and three (3) mass-squared splittings.

If neutrinos are their own antiparticles, they do not follow the Dirac Equation
 but do follow the Majorana Equation.
 This adds two (in general 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$

) more CP violating Majorana phases, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Unfortunately, neutrino oscillations are not able to probe the Majorana
 phases since the Majorana matrix is diagonal.
 The question of if neutrinos are Majorana (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\overline{\nu})$
\end_inset

 or Dirac (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\neq\overline{\nu})$
\end_inset

 particles is an open question and is being explored by non-oscillation
 experiments.

The full three flavor oscillation probability is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\mathcal{P}\left(\nu_{\alpha}\rightarrow\nu_{\beta}\right)=\delta_{\alpha\beta}-4 & \sum_{j=1}^{3}\left[\sum_{i>j}^{3}\text{Re}\left(K_{\alpha\beta,ij}\right)\sin^{2}\left(\phi_{ij}\right)\right]\\
+4 & \sum_{j=1}^{3}\left[\sum_{i>j}^{3}\text{Im}\left(K_{\alpha\beta,ij}\right)\sin\left(\phi_{ij}\right)\cos\left(\phi_{ij}\right)\right]

\begin{equation}
K_{\alpha\beta,ij}=U_{\alpha i}U_{\beta_{i}}^{*}U_{\alpha j}^{*}U_{\beta j}\label{eq:threeflavorprobgeneralK}

\begin{equation}
\phi_{ij}=\frac{\Dm ijc^{3}}{4\hbar}\frac{L}{E_{\nu}}.\label{eq:threeflavorprobgeneralphi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since CP violation means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}\left(\nuparticle{\alpha}\rightarrow\nuparticle{\beta\neq\alpha}\right)\neq\mathcal{P}\left(\antinuparticle{\alpha}\rightarrow\antinuparticle{\beta\neq\alpha}\right),$

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude the introduction on neutrinos, it is important to examine the
 implications of CP violation.
 The observation of CP violation in the lepton sector might provide critical
 insight into the origins of the matter.
 CP violation dictates that certain interactions behave differently between
 matter or antimatter like 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}\left(\numu\rightarrow\nue\right)\neq\mathcal{P}\left(\antinumu\rightarrow\antinue\right)$
\end_inset

 The Big Bang Theory suggests that in the first fractions of a second of
 the Universe, equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created.
 However, observational evidence shows the Universe consists of only 4.5%
 baryonic matter (i.e.
 protons and neutrons) from cosmological models as shown in

 Each linac element except for the initial quadrapole magnet apparatus accelerat
es the ions using carefully coordinated oscillating electric fields generated
 by radio frequency pulses.
 After traveling 240m along the linac, the ions have been boosted to 181
 MeV of kinetic energy and transported into the RCS.
 In transit to the RCS, the ions are stripped of their electrons via charge
 stripping foils.
 The 348m circumference RCS then further boosts the protons to 3 GeV at
 an operating frequency of 25 Hz.
 While being accelerated, protons are aggregated into two bunches and focused

T2K has a near detector (ND) site at J-PARC that is designed specifically
 observe the neutrinos in flight.
 The purpose of a ND site is due to large uncertainties from the neutrino
 flux in previous neutrino oscillation experiments.
 The site is called ND280 and is located 280m away from the production target.
 The primary detector is an off-axis, magnetized tracking detector.
 A separate detector array called the Interactive Neutrino Grid (INGRID)
 measures the neutrino beam profile.
 Both on-axis and off-axis detectors extensively utilize a commercial light
 sensor called a multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) for the light collection
 in the scintillator-based detectors.

While the reliable photo-multiplier tube (PMT) technology was used in previous

 T2K selected a commercially available silicon photomultiplier sensor developed

 A MPPC is a compact device containing many sensitive avalanche photodiode
 pixels that act as Geiger micro-counters.
 They are well matched with the spectral emission of wavelength-shifting

ND280 consists of the pi-zero detector (
\begin_inset Formula $\pod$
\end_inset

), the tracker region consisting of a fine grain detector (FGD) and time
 projection chamber (TPC), an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal), and side
 muon range detector (SMRD).
 The ND280 subdetectors are instrumented inside the recycled UA1/NOMAD magnet
 with the SMRD in the magnetic field return yoke itself.
 A schematic of the different detector components of ND280 is shown in

The ND280 magnetic field is generated using electrical current fed through
 solenoid coils to generate a dipole field of strength 0.2 T in the x direction.
 The field is highly uniform near the center of the detector

0.2 T is a powerful magnetic field.
 According to the The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2015-2020, the magnetic
 field strength on the surface of the Earth is about 0.

 So the field inside ND280 is about 6800 times more forceful than the Earth's
 influence

 which is where the majority of the TPC system is located.
 However, it has significant deviations from 0.2 T when close the solenoid
 edges.
 The field was measured thoroughly to produce a 3D model which has been
 also compared with measurements in ND280 interior as shown in

 serves as a massive target for the incident neutrino beam and the TPC serves
 to measure the charge and momentum of the outgoing particles.
